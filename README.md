# notebook-demo
Jupyter Notebooks curated by SQuaRE for demos and testing.

> **Note:** there is a special branch called `prod` in this repo that is continuously deployed into production. Do not update this branch unless you know what you are doing. (Better instructions that "know what you are doing" will be forthcoming once the workflow settles down).

## General setup
Once you have started your JupyterLab session, start a terminal and
```bash
cd ~/notebooks
git clone https://github.com/lsst-sqre/notebook-demo.git
```
In your JupyterLab fileviewer you will now see a directory called notebook-demo where you will find the demo notebooks. 

## Contributing
If you modify the demo notebooks and think your changes might be helpful to others, feel free to submit a pull request from a fork of this repo. Don't forget to clear your notebooks' outputs before committing! If you have any questions or suggestions, please [write us an issue](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/notebook-demo/issues).
